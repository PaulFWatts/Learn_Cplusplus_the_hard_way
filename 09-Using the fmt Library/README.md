09: Using the fmt Library
I find the C++ style of formatting strings using a cout style operation to be...odd. It works, sure, but it's not how any other programming language does it. Other programming languages use something called a "format string" or possibly a "template" to craft strings from other data. In this exercise we'll use a nice library called fmt to format strings.

The purpose of this exercise is two-fold:

Learn how fmt works, which is also very similar to the C++ std::format with additional features.
Learn how to add other people's open source projects to your own project to get their features.
